## Form Hook \(callBacks\)


</div>

### Description

This code demonstates how to make a form "Stick" to the edges of the screen if the form is released a certain distance from the screen. Also, I think this is neat, if you have a scroll mouse, you can move the form up and down by scrolling the mouse wheel. The things mentioned above are done using windows messages to determine if the mouse button has been released and to determine which way the scroll whell has been moved. Please feel free to add things onto this. Comments are always very welcome.Thnx
